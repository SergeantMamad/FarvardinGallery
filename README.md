# Farvardin Gallery

I created this project for my university final exam (using react and tailwind ofc). I focused on design more than anything else but it has some features.

## Features

* Art liking system
* Preview uploaded pics in art upload page
* Some cool css animations
* Little but cool design touches (Search options in "Khatati" page, Table filter option, etc...) that you can see in pictures i provided below

## Used Libraries (Beside React)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com)
* [Mui](https://mui.com/)
* [React Starfield](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-starfield)
